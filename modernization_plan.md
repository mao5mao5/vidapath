I have modernized the `cytomine-table` component by updating its styles to be more consistent with the new, modern color palette. The table should now have a cleaner and more visually appealing look.

Here is a plan to modernize other basic components to ensure a consistent and beautiful UI across the application:

### 1. Buttons

I will refine the button styles to provide more visual feedback to the user. This includes:
*   **Sizes:** Defining a clear and consistent size scale for buttons (small, medium, large).
*   **States:** Improving the styles for different button states like hover, focus, active, disabled, and loading.
*   **Hierarchy:** Ensuring a clear visual distinction between primary, secondary, and tertiary buttons.

### 2. Forms

I will modernize the form elements to improve their usability and appearance:
*   **Inputs:** I will improve the styling of text inputs, textareas, and select dropdowns with better spacing, clear focus states, and consistent validation styling.
*   **Checkboxes and Radio Buttons:** I will restyle checkboxes and radio buttons to be more modern and easier to click.
*   **Labels and Help Text:** I will ensure that form labels and help text are clear, legible, and well-aligned.

### 3. Modals

I will update the modal dialogs to be more modern and user-friendly:
*   **Layout:** I will improve the layout of modals to ensure a clear hierarchy of information.
*   **Styling:** I will update the styling of modals to match the new design language, with rounded corners, subtle shadows, and consistent button placement.
*   **Animations:** I will add subtle animations to make the modals appear and disappear more smoothly.

### 4. Notifications

I will redesign the notification component to be more modern and less intrusive:
*   **Appearance:** I will update the appearance of notifications to match the new design language, with different styles for success, error, warning, and info messages.
*   **Positioning and Animation:** I will review the positioning and animation of notifications to ensure they are noticeable but not disruptive.

By modernizing these basic components, we can create a more cohesive, beautiful, and user-friendly interface. I will start with the buttons.
