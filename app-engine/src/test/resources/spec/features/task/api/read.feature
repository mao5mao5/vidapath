Feature: [URS00002-TASK] Read task information

  Read task information via Task API, technically documented in "src/main/resources/spec/api/openapi_spec_v0.1.0.yml" file.

  Background:
    Given App Engine is up and running
    And File storage service is up and running

  Scenario Outline: successful fetch of all App Engine available tasks

  See "src/main/resources/spec/api/openapi_spec_v0.1.0.yml" file, in particular the paths:
  - '/tasks'

    Given a set of valid tasks has been successfully uploaded
    When user calls the endpoint "<endpoint>" (excluding version prefix, e.g. '/api/v1') with HTTP method "<method>"
    Then App Engine retrieves relevant data from the database
    And App Engine sends a "200" OK response with a payload containing the descriptions of the available tasks as a JSON payload (see OpenAPI spec)

    Examples:
      | method | endpoint |
      | GET    | tasks    |

  Scenario Outline: successful download of the descriptor file with namespace and version

  See "src/main/resources/spec/api/openapi_spec_v0.1.0.yml" file, in particular the paths:
  - '/tasks/{namespace}/{version}/descriptor.yml'

    Given a valid task has a "<task namespace>", a "<task version>" and "<task uuid>" has been successfully uploaded
    And the task descriptor is stored in the file storage service in storage "<task storage identifier>" under filename "descriptor.yml"
    When user calls the download endpoint with "<task namespace>" and "<task version>" with HTTP method GET
    Then App Engine retrieves the descriptor file "descriptor.yml" from the file storage
    And App Engine sends a "200" OK response with the descriptor file as a binary payload (see OpenAPI spec)

    Examples:
      | task    | task namespace                                 | task version | task uuid                            | task storage identifier                       |
