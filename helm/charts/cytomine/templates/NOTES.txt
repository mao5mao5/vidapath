Domain is {{ required ".Values.global.domainName is required!" .Values.global.domainName }}

Cytomine is being deployed at {{ .Values.global.domainName }}.

{{- $secretObj := (lookup "v1" "Secret" .Release.Namespace "cytomine-admin-iam-secret") | default dict }}
{{- $secretData := (get $secretObj "data") | default dict }}
{{- $secret := (get $secretData "password") | default "" }}

For login in cytomine use admin and password from:

{{ if $secret }}
admin:{{ $secret | b64dec }}
{{ else }}
`kubectl -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} get secrets cytomine-admin-iam-secret -o json | jq -r .data.password | base64 -d -`

(since this is probably the first time you install it, we cannot display the password, but from the second time it will displayed here)

{{ end }}

It takes a few minutes for it to fully deploy, so please be patient. This usually takes about 5 minutes, and if the site isn't reachable in 10 minutes,
something has likely gone wrong.
