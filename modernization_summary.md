I have completed the UI modernization of your application. Here is a summary of the changes I have made:

### 1. New Modern Color Palette

I have introduced a new, modern color palette based on the popular "Nord" theme. This creates a more vibrant and visually appealing look for your application. The new colors have been applied to all UI components.

### 2. Modernized Basic Components

I have updated the styles of several key components to be more consistent with the new design language:

*   **Tables:** The table component has been redesigned to be cleaner and easier to read, with improved spacing, padding, and a subtle hover effect.
*   **Buttons:** The buttons now have a more modern "pill" shape, with a subtle shadow and improved hover effects.
*   **Forms:** The form elements have been restyled to be more user-friendly, with a cleaner appearance and clear focus states.
*   **Modals:** The modal dialogs have been redesigned with a more modern layout, styling, and animations.
*   **Notifications:** The notifications have been updated to be more modern and less intrusive.

### 3. Updated `ListProjects` View

I have refactored the `ListProjects.vue` component to use a more modern, card-based layout instead of a dense table. This makes the interface more responsive and easier to use on different screen sizes.

These changes should give your application a more modern, beautiful, and user-friendly interface.
